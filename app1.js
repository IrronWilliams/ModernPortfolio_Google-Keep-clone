    create a variable newNote set equal to an object with the data properties. the 'id' property can be used to check if there are any
    notes. can use a ternary to check if the length of the notes array >0. if >0, take length of array and add 1 on to it. this will 
    increment the last id by 1.  if length of notes >0 then take the entire array from this.notes, select the last item with

      id: this.notes.length > 0 ? this.notes[this.notes.length - 1].id + 1

    approach used with the closeForm() method. if there are notes, hide placeholder (set display to none). otherwise if there are no

    1st check the array to see if there are any notes and store in a variable -> const hasNotes = this.notes.length > 0. then conditionally
    check if there are any notes. update constructor with reference to placeholder. can now conditionally check if array has notes. if
    notes in array, do not display placeholder by updating the style.display to none. if no notes in array, display placeholder:

      if (hasNotes) {

       this.$placeholder.style.display = 'flex'

    this can be shortened via a ternary. if array has notes, return a string of 'none' else return a string of 'flex'. can conditionally 
    update placeholders display property as follows: 
      this.$placeholder.style.display = hasNotes ? 'none' : 'flex'

    use an inline style to set the background of the note to white. have an inner div which contains the title. the inner div will  
    conditionally set a class  which can be done with the && operator. whereby if there is a title in the note, then use the class 
    'note-title'. create another div that holds the notes text ('note.text'). create another div that holds a toolbar which allows user 
    to delete/change color of note. to use the html/to display on page, output on notes container on the html file <div id="notes"></div>.
    
    to display the html, create a reference to the notes container in the constructor (with div with id of notes). then put all of the 
    templated data using map by associating  this.$notes.innerHTML = this.notes.map(note => 
    
    .join() - joins together all of the templated notes into a single string. w/o join() each note will be followed by a comma.
